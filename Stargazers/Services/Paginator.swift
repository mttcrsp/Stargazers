                    //     to be loaded matches a multiple of the page size;
                    //  3. ...

                    // I decided to go for this implementation fully knowing
                    // that this is not production level code because its very
                    // easy to implement and leads to a pretty simple API. It
                    // only has one `loadMore` function that can be overloaded
                    // with calls and it will automatically behave as intended,
